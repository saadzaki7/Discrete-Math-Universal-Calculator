yo i got 5
u think u could link 3a
Yeti â€” 05/11/2022
Image
.Astro â€” 05/11/2022
Image
also did u get the same shit for 1
Image
rlly dont wanna lose these free marks
Yeti â€” 05/11/2022
f is inc if approved
https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/804195/viewContent/4383412/View
c is 8 and 10 from this site
.Astro â€” 05/11/2022
i was using this one but i think urs is prolly better cuz its specific to crowdmark
Image
.Astro â€” 05/11/2022
for f would it even be possible for inc to be considered cuz of the crowdmark portion?
Image
Image
Yeti â€” 05/11/2022
ohhhh that's true
Yeti â€” 05/11/2022
I've solved 5  too, just got 4c left at this point
.Astro â€” 05/11/2022
same
for 2b did u get 480i?
Yeti â€” 05/11/2022
yes
.Astro â€” 05/15/2022
yo how r u studying for econ?
reading slides makes me wanna kms
Yeti â€” 05/15/2022
I haven't started studying yet ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
.Astro â€” 05/15/2022
bruh
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
yo have u started the math assignment?
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
yeah doing it rn
stuck on q2
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
a or b?
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
a
I hate this course so much ðŸ¥²
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
since l is orthogonal its the normal aswell
so u can use (-5,2,0) as the normal to find the sclar equation
orthogonal to the plan so its the normal
and for vector i used the 3 point strat
i can send u my work if u want
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
x = (-5,1,0) + t(L)? basically?
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
maybe
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
yes id appreciate that, struggling to wrap my head aeound this
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
i used a diff order so idk if the same algebraicilly
one sec
Image
lmk if i did smtg wrong
also obv use diff numbers for the points so we dont get caught
any random points work
j dont make them all parrallel
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022

here's what online grapher says
scalar equation should be -5x+2y = 27 then
which is what you got i think
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
i get the logic for this, just not sure how to EXACTLY do it in a way where they dont rape me in markihg
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
wouldnt it be (3,0,7)
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
yes although that didnt change the answer
.Astro â€” 05/18/2022
weird for me it did
Image
did i do it wrong?
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
no?
n = (-5,2,0)
we want a plane perp to n which contains the given point

yo how much r u done so far?
im almost done
Yeti â€” 05/18/2022
im stuck on 2a, need to convert the scalar into vector form
prolly gonna need to stay up all night
